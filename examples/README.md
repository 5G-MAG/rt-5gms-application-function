# 5G-MAG Reference Tools: 5GMS Application Function Example Configurations

This directory contains examples of configurations for the 5GMS Application Function.

## `ContentHostingConfiguration_Big-Buck-Bunny_pull-ingest.json`

This file is used as a content hosting configuration for the rt-5gms-application-function.

It contains a ContentHostingConfiguration, based on 3GPP TS 26.512 Release 17.3.0, which points to a media origin host, suitable for use with pull-ingest, which holds the Big Buck Bunny short animated film.

The distribution side of the configurations tells the rt-5gms-application-function to configure a 5GMS Application Server to reverse proxy the media on its localhost (127.0.0.1) loopback interface. The distribution configuration object is left empty as this is a simple distribution where all fields are generated by the 5GMS Application Function. Note that there needs to be at least one entry in `distributionConfigurations`, even if it is an empty object.

## `ContentHostingConfiguration_Big-Buck-Bunny_pull-ingest_http_and_https.json.tmpl`

This template file is an alternative to `ContentHostingConfiguration_Big-Buck-Bunny_pull-ingest.json` (see above) and can be used to configure a rt-5gms-application-function to provision a 5GMS Application Server which will provide both HTTP and HTTPS distribution points. Before the contents of this file can be used as a configuration `@certificate-id@` must be substituted for a valid certificate id for the provisioning session you wish to add the configuration to.

## `ContentHostingConfiguration_Big-Buck-Bunny_pull-ingest_https.json.tmpl`

This template file is an alternative to `ContentHostingConfiguration_Big-Buck-Bunny_pull-ingest.json` (see above) and can be used to configure a rt-5gms-application-function to provision a 5GMS Application Server which will provide an HTTPS distribution point only. Before the contents of this file can be used as a configuration `@certificate-id@` must be substituted for a valid certific
ate id for the provisioning session you wish to add the configuration to.
